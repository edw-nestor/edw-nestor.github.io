    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tried to follow the instructions on their website for pre-packaged binary
but it did not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions were for mint 16 and 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then i tried to install from source following their instructions and that did
not work either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was apt-get could not find the required dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then I decided to try and download source tar ball and proceed with
./configure, make, sudo make install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping mint 15 would have enough tools/libs to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked, everything seems to be running fine. I know it's not a very smart
way to proceed, but I decieded I could always abort the process if something 
went, wrong.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The make took a super long time, in fact, I was starting to think it was hung
but I left it alone and it finnished.&lt;/p&gt;
