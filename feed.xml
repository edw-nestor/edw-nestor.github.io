    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tried to follow the instructions on their website for pre-packaged binary
but it did not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions were for mint 16 and 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;table style="border-spacing: 0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"&gt;&lt;pre class="lineno"&gt;1
2
3&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;cool&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"I'm cool"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then i tried to install from source following their instructions and that did
not work either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was apt-get could not find the required dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then I decided to try and download source tar ball and proceed with
./configure, make, sudo make install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping mint 15 would have enough tools/libs to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked, everything seems to be running fine. I know it&amp;rsquo;s not a very smart
way to proceed, but I decieded I could always abort the process if something 
went, wrong.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The make took a super long time, in fact, I was starting to think it was hung
but I left it alone and it finnished.&lt;/p&gt;
